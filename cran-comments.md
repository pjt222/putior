## R-hub nosuggests check

The nosuggests check fails as expected because the package vignettes require rmarkdown (listed in Suggests). The package functions correctly without suggested packages installed - only vignette building is affected. This is standard behavior for packages with vignettes and does not impact package functionality.

## Initial submission

This is the first submission of the putior package to CRAN.

## Package purpose

putior helps users document and visualize workflows by extracting structured annotations from source code files and generating Mermaid diagrams. It supports multiple programming languages and is particularly useful for documenting data science pipelines.

## Dependencies

This package has minimal dependencies, requiring only base R and the tools package.
