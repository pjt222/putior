## üìã Remaining Steps

### 1. Monitor Platform Check Results

**Win-builder results** (expected within 15-30 minutes):
- Check email for results from win-builder.r-project.org
- Expected: Clean checks with only "New submission" NOTE

**R-hub results** (live at GitHub Actions):
- Monitor: https://github.com/pjt222/putior/actions
- Expected: All platforms PASS (nosuggests expected to fail due to vignettes)

### 2. Final Pre-submission Check

Once platform results are available:

```r
# Final comprehensive check
devtools::check(manual = TRUE, cran = TRUE)

# Ensure build artifacts are clean
R CMD build .
R CMD check putior_0.1.0.tar.gz
```

### 3. Update cran-comments.md

After platform results are received:
- Update with actual win-builder results
- Include R-hub platform check outcomes
- Note any platform-specific issues

### 4. Submit to CRAN

```r
# This will guide you through the submission process
devtools::release()
```

This will:
- Run final checks
- Build the source package
- Upload to CRAN's submission portal
- Create a git tag for the release

### 5. Post-Submission

After submission:
1. Watch for CRAN emails (usually within 24-48 hours)
2. Be prepared to make quick fixes if requested
3. Once accepted, announce the release!

## üìù Notes

- First submissions often take longer (up to 2 weeks)
- CRAN maintainers may request changes - respond promptly
- The single NOTE about system time is acceptable and common
- Your package is well-prepared with good documentation and tests

Good luck with your CRAN submission!
