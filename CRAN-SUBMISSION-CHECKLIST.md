## üìã Remaining Manual Steps

### 1. Test on Multiple Platforms

From your local R session with pandoc available:

```r
# Test on win-builder (do both)
devtools::check_win_devel()
devtools::check_win_release()

# Test on R-hub
rhub::check_for_cran()
```

### 2. Additional Checks

```r
# Spell check (requires spelling package)
install.packages("spelling")
devtools::spell_check()

# URL check (requires urlchecker package)
install.packages("urlchecker")
urlchecker::url_check()

# Final comprehensive check
devtools::check(manual = TRUE, cran = TRUE)
```

### 3. Update cran-comments.md

After running the above checks, update `cran-comments.md` with:
- Actual test results from win-builder (both devel and release)
- R-hub test results
- Any NOTEs from different platforms

### 4. Submit to CRAN

```r
# This will guide you through the submission process
devtools::release()
```

This will:
- Run final checks
- Build the source package
- Upload to CRAN's submission portal
- Create a git tag for the release

### 5. Post-Submission

After submission:
1. Watch for CRAN emails (usually within 24-48 hours)
2. Be prepared to make quick fixes if requested
3. Once accepted, announce the release!

## üìù Notes

- First submissions often take longer (up to 2 weeks)
- CRAN maintainers may request changes - respond promptly
- The single NOTE about system time is acceptable and common
- Your package is well-prepared with good documentation and tests

Good luck with your CRAN submission!
